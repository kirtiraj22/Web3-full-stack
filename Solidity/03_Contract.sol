//defining a contract
//contract is a keyword and it tells the compiler that the next piece of the code is going to define the contract of solidity
//we can think of contracts as a class in any Object oriented programming language like java, c++, etc
//we can give any name to our contract
//it is preferred to name contracts using CapWords style for eg : SimpleStorage, Player, ContractName, etc
//everything inside the curly braces is the content of the contract
