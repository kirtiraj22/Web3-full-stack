//we can completely reset an array by using the following syntax : 

arrayName = new address[](0);

//for eg :
funders = new address[](0);

//the above line of code will reset the funders array from 0th index
//if we have 
funders = new address[](1);
//the above line will reset the array starting from the index 1.
