pragma solidity ^0.8.7; //This defines version of solidity(0.8.19 is latest)
//using ^ before the version means that this code will work on any version above 0.8.7
//we can also use just 0.8.7
//we can also use >=0.8.7 <0.9.0 this means all versions between 0.8.7(inclusive) amd 0.9.0(exclusive)

//defining versions at top in solidity is necessary
